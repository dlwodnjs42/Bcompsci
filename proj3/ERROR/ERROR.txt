We are getting an Ascii error when the autograder runs test 34 and test 35 dealing with merge-Conflict.
When we test it manually on our end, there is no issue and the contents of the file are easily readable by humans
and match the expected output. We used a slight modification to Utils.writeContents but it still complains.
We are thoroughly unsure of as to why this occurs.
The method we believe this is occurring in is: 
Gitlet.mergeConflict(File, File, String) or Gitlet.mergeStatement() where somewhere the boolean 'conflict' is not
being correctly set.
Thanks!
