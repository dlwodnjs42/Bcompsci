# GITLET

This version-control system mimics some of the basic features of the popular version-control system git, but it is smaller and simpler.

### Main Functionality

 - Saving backups of directories of files. In gitlet, this is called committing, and the backups themselves are called commits.
Restoring a backup version of one or more files or entire commits. In gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.

 - Viewing the history of your backups. In gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.

 - Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.

 - Merging changes made in one branch into another.

 - The point of a version-control system is to help you when coding complicated projects, or when collaborating with others on a project. You save versions of the project periodically. If at some later point in time you accidentally mess up your code, then you can restore your source to a previously committed version (without losing any of the changes you made since then).
